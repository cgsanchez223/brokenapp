# Broken App Issues
- Added a 404 Error Handler
- Added a general error handler
- Rewrote code to properly await for requests to finish before completing promises.
- Properly using the listening port to be able to view page on server
- Edited the properties on the json code from stringify to express.json. This allows to accept various types of json files instead of just a string.
